# :stars: Star Relay Subgraph :stars:

ðŸŒŸ Welcome to Star Relay ðŸŒŸ

Star Relay is a decentralized application on Ethereum and IPFS for challenging your friends to do cool stuff during this boring COVID while potentially fundraising for charity causes you believe in. Upload a video of you doing 10-clap-push-ups and start a challenge relay to invite your friends to do the same! Soon you will be able to OWN a challenge as an NFT. How cool is it to own the _2014 ALS Ice Bucket Challenge_ or a series of videos of cool dance moves from _ETHDenver 2021_? Keep in tune!

## Entities at Quick Glance
Here's a quick summary of the entities indexed. Next to come: Tags and ChallengeSearch for better discoverability of the platform content! You can also play around with the data in the Graph's explorer here: https://thegraph.com/explorer/subgraph/ehsueh/star-relay 

### Contract

## For Devs!!!

### Deploy the graph to rinkeby:
1. Generate subgraph yaml for rinkeby: `yarn run prep:rinkeby`
2. Deploy the subgraph: `graph deploy --node https://api.thegraph.com/deploy/ --ipfs https://api.thegraph.com/ipfs/ username/star-relay --access-token copy-from-your-dashboard`
_Note:_ if you want to deploy to another network, you can add a config json in `./network/` and run step one with the name of your json file. E.g. add `./network/mainnet.json` and `yarn run prep:mainnet` to pay expensive gas! ðŸ˜ƒ
